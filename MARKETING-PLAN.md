# AI Hustle Engine — Complete Marketing Plan
**Prepared by Henry (AI Agent) | February 26, 2026**
**Version 1.0 — Execution-Ready**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

AI Hustle Engine is an email-first, content-led info-product business targeting the exploding "make money with AI" niche. The strategy is simple: Henry runs an autonomous content and email engine that pulls in leads through SEO-optimized blog posts and YouTube videos, captures them with a high-value free lead magnet, and converts them through a carefully designed email funnel — all without requiring G to spend more than 2-3 hours per week on review and approval. Revenue scales through three tiers ($27/$97/$297), with the $27 Starter Kit acting as a low-friction entry point that feeds into the $97 Accelerator via automated upsell sequences. An affiliate program turns buyers into promoters, creating compounding organic reach.

**North Star for Year 1:** 1,000 email subscribers → 100 Starter Kit buyers → 30 Accelerator buyers → 5 Inner Circle members = ~$14,000 MRR potential at scale.

---

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Persona: "The Overwhelmed Opportunist"
- **Age:** 25–45
- **Job:** Mid-level employee, freelancer, or recent grad
- **Income:** $35K–$75K/year — comfortable enough to buy a $27 product, not rich enough to feel secure
- **Location:** US, UK, Canada, Australia (English-speaking markets)
- **Tech comfort:** Uses ChatGPT regularly, but doesn't code
- **Time:** 5–15 hours/week to build a side income

### Secondary Persona: "The Hustler Who's Tired of Hustle"
- Tried dropshipping, affiliate marketing, or social media — burned out
- Believes AI is the new leverage but doesn't know where to start
- Wants systems, not grind

### Psychographics
- Feels left behind by the AI revolution but doesn't know how to catch up
- Motivated by financial freedom and time autonomy, not just income
- Skeptical of "get rich quick" but open to "get paid for real skills"
- Values proof over promises (case studies, screenshots, specific numbers)
- Identity: "I'm the kind of person who figures things out"

### Core Pain Points
1. "I see people making money with AI but I don't know where to start"
2. "I'm not a programmer — I thought AI tools were just for techies"
3. "I've tried other side hustles and wasted months without results"
4. "I don't have thousands to invest in courses or ads"
5. "I don't have 40 hours a week — I need something that works in the cracks"

### Primary Objections
| Objection | Counter |
|-----------|---------|
| "I'm not technical" | Zero coding required — prompts are plain English |
| "Is this legit?" | Specific income models, real tools, transparent numbers |
| "Will this work for me?" | 5 different income models — one fits every situation |
| "$27 seems cheap, must be junk" | Low price on purpose — we don't gatekeep the basics |
| "I've bought courses before and didn't finish them" | Starter Kit is a PDF + vault, not a 50-module video marathon |
