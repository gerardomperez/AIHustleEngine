Seeing [SPECIFIC METRIC OR OUTCOME] has been genuinely exciting to watch.\n\nI have a small favor to ask — and I completely understand if you're too busy.\n\nWe're putting together some case studies to help other [CLIENT TYPE] businesses understand what's possible with AI [or your service]. Your story would be a perfect fit because of [SPECIFIC REASON — unique situation, fast results, notable challenge overcome].\n\nIf you're willing, here are 3 questions that would take about 5-10 minutes to answer:\n\n1. **Before we worked together:** What was the situation and what challenge were you trying to solve?\n\n2. **During the work:** What was the process like and what stood out to you?\n\n3. **After (now):** What specific results have you seen, and how has it impacted your business?\n\nYou can reply directly to this email, record a quick Loom, or if you'd prefer, I can schedule a 10-minute call and write it up for your review.\n\nWhatever format works for you works for me.\n\nEither way — thank you for being such a great client to work with. Looking forward to our next project together.\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n\nP.S. If you feel comfortable sharing this publicly, it'll be featured on [YOUR WEBSITE/SOCIAL MEDIA]. If you'd prefer to keep it anonymous or private (for internal use only), that works perfectly too — just let me know."
